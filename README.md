# PowerBI_Sales_Dashboard

Built a fully interactive Power BI dashboard that transforms raw sales data into strategic business intelligence.
This project showcases advanced DAX calculations, data modeling, and Power Query to uncover patterns in sales performance, product trends, customer returns, and geographic impact.

With layered visuals, KPIs, and dynamic filters, the dashboard tells a clear data story - comparing actuals vs. targets, breaking down category performance, and tracking return rates.
